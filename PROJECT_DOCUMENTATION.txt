================================================================================
9. SECURITY IMPLEMENTATION
================================================================================

9.1 AUTHENTICATION SECURITY

Password Storage:
- Never store plain text passwords
- Bcrypt hashing algorithm
- Salt rounds: 12
- Password strength validation on frontend
- Minimum 8 characters recommended

JWT Token Management:
- Tokens signed with HS256 algorithm
- Secret key stored in environment variables
- Token expiration: 24 hours
- Token includes user email and role
- Automatic token validation on each request

Session Management:
- Token stored in localStorage
- Cleared on logout
- Automatically checked on page load
- Expired tokens force re-login

9.2 AUTHORIZATION

Route Protection:
- Frontend: ProtectedRoute component wrapper
- Backend: require_auth and require_roles decorators
- Role verification on every protected endpoint
- Unauthorized access returns 401/403 status

Role-Based Access:
- Admin: Full access
- HR: Limited to candidate and report management
- Recruiter: Limited to viewing and interview submission
- Public: Only /apply endpoint

9.3 DATA SECURITY

Database Security:
- MongoDB Atlas with TLS/SSL encryption
- IP whitelisting enabled
- Strong database passwords
- Connection string in environment variables
- Regular automated backups

API Security:
- CORS policy restricting origins
- Input validation using Pydantic models
- SQL injection prevention (NoSQL database)
- XSS protection with proper escaping
- HTTPS enforced in production

Environment Variables:
- Sensitive data in .env file
- .env excluded from version control
- Different configurations for dev/prod
- Secure key generation for JWT

9.4 VULNERABILITY PREVENTION

Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):
- React automatically escapes output
- No dangerouslySetInnerHTML usage
- Content Security Policy headers

Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF):
- JWT tokens in headers (not cookies)
- Origin validation
- Custom headers for API calls

Injection Attacks:
- Pydantic validation prevents injection
- MongoDB parameterized queries
- Input sanitization

Brute Force Protection:
- Account lockout (to be implemented)
- Rate limiting (to be implemented)
- Failed login attempt logging

Data Exposure:
- Sensitive fields excluded from responses
- Error messages don't leak system info
- Stack traces hidden in production

9.5 COMPLIANCE AND BEST PRACTICES

Data Privacy:
- Minimal data collection
- Secure data transmission (HTTPS/TLS)
- Access logs maintained
- User consent for data processing (implied)

Security Best Practices:
- Regular dependency updates
- Security headers implemented
- No hardcoded credentials
- Secure session management
- Regular security audits recommended

Audit Trail:
- All critical actions logged
- User actions traceable
- Timestamp on all operations
- Immutable audit logs
